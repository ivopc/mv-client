# Monster Valle Client

> Monster Valle Client, contains the old and new architecture. Monster Valle is a full-featured MMORPG based on Pok√©mon. No guides released yet. The core of the game is on (**/src/game/**) if you want to contribute help me to rewrite the old source with crap architecture (**/src/game-old/**) to new one. You can download the server here: https://github.com/ivopc/new-mv-server .  If you want to rewrite the older source to that and contribute, you're free :)
