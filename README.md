# Monster Valle Client

Monster Valle Client, contains the old and new architecture.

Monster Valle is a full-featured MMORPG based on PokÃ©mon. No guides released yet.

The core of the game is on (**/src/game/**) if you want to contribute help me to rewrite the old source with crap architecture (**/src/game-old/**) to new one.

> The `new-client` branch is suitable to the `new-mv-server` repo and the `old-client-server` is suitable to `old-mv-server` :)


You can download the server here: https://github.com/ivopc/new-mv-server .  If you want to rewrite the older source to that and contribute, you're free :)
